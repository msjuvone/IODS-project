## About the Open Data Course

The course consists of weekly DataCamp exercises as well as Rstudio exercises that will be stored in a personal GitHub repository and peer reviewed.

This course seems like a good way of learning the basic stuff about R and using GitHub. I hope i won't be dissapointed!
